# 1 Introduction

This lab served as an introduction to white-box testing design and implementation. We utilized coverage metrics to analyze the effectiveness of our test suite from the previous assignment, then designed new white-box test cases using control-flow coverage metrics such as statement and branch coverage and measued the improvement relative to our original code, and measured the data-flow coverage of specific methods. This lab provided experience developing and analyzing white-box tests and demonstrated the benefits and drawbacks of coverage-based testing relative to requirement-based testing.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Text…

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Text…

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
